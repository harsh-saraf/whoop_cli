# whoop-cli

Your WHOOP data, from the terminal. Built for humans and agents.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @tomasward/whoop-cli
```

Both `whoop` and `whoop-cli` work as commands. Requires Node.js 22+.

## Setup

```bash
whoop auth login
```

First time? The CLI walks you through it:

```
WHOOP CLI — First-time setup
────────────────────────────

1. Go to https://developer.whoop.com
2. Create an application (apps with <10 users need no review)
3. Set the Redirect URI to: http://localhost:8787/callback
4. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret below

Everything stays local in ~/.whoop-cli/config.json

Client ID: ________
Client Secret: ********

✓ Credentials saved
```

Then it opens your browser for OAuth. Authorize, paste the callback URL, done. Tokens auto-refresh after that — you won't need to log in again.

## Usage

### Quick check

```bash
whoop check              # Today's health snapshot
whoop summary --color    # Color-coded with status indicators
whoop insights           # Personalized recommendations
whoop awake              # Is user awake? (exit 0 = yes, 1 = no)
```

In a terminal, `check` shows a human-readable summary:

```
📅 2026-03-02
🟢 Recovery: 75% | HRV: 106ms | RHR: 37bpm
🟢 Sleep: 76% | 7.5h | Efficiency: 92%
🟡 Strain: 6.9 (optimal: ~14) | 1649 cal
🏋️ Workouts: 1 | Strength Training
```

Piped or in a script, it outputs flat JSON automatically.

### Data commands

```bash
whoop recovery           # Today's recovery
whoop sleep              # Today's sleep
whoop workout            # Today's workouts
whoop cycle              # Today's cycle
whoop profile            # User profile
whoop body               # Body measurements
```

### Date ranges

```bash
whoop workout -d 2026-01-15                       # Specific date
whoop workout -s 2026-01-01 -e 2026-03-01         # Date range
whoop workout -s 2026-01-01 -e 2026-03-01 -a      # All pages
```

### Trends & insights

```bash
whoop trends                # 7-day trends
whoop trends --days 30      # Any period (1-90 days)
whoop insights              # Health recommendations
```

### Multi-type fetch

```bash
whoop multi --sleep --recovery --body
whoop multi --sleep --workout -s 2026-01-01 -e 2026-03-01 -a
```

### Auth

```bash
whoop auth login             # OAuth flow (opens browser)
whoop auth status            # Check auth state
whoop auth refresh           # Force token refresh
whoop auth keepalive         # Install cron to auto-refresh tokens
whoop auth keepalive --status   # Check if keepalive is active
whoop auth keepalive --disable  # Remove keepalive cron
whoop auth logout            # Clear tokens
```

## Output

**TTY-aware** — the CLI detects how you're using it:

| Context | Output |
|---------|--------|
| Terminal (human) | Pretty text, color-coded |
| Piped / scripted (agent) | Structured JSON to stdout |

Force a specific format:

```bash
whoop recovery --format json      # Force JSON
whoop recovery --format pretty    # Force pretty
whoop recovery --pretty           # Shorthand
```

## Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-d, --date <date>` | Date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `-s, --start <date>` | Start date for range |
| `-e, --end <date>` | End date for range |
| `-l, --limit <n>` | Results per page (default: 25) |
| `-a, --all` | Fetch all pages |
| `-f, --format <fmt>` | `json`, `pretty`, or `auto` (default: auto) |
| `-p, --pretty` | Shorthand for `--format pretty` |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success / awake (for `whoop awake`) |
| 1 | General error / not awake (for `whoop awake`) |
| 2 | Auth error (not logged in, bad credentials) |
| 3 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 4 | Network error |

## For Agents

### Install as an agent skill

Teach your AI coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex, etc.) how to use WHOOP data:

```bash
npx skills add TomasWard1/whoop-cli
```

This installs the skill globally — your agent will automatically use `whoop` commands when you ask about health metrics, recovery, sleep, or strain.

> Requires the CLI to be installed separately: `npm install -g @tomasward/whoop-cli`

### JSON output

Agents get JSON automatically when output is piped. Recommended starting point:

```bash
whoop check    # → {"ok":true,"recovery_score":75,"hrv_rmssd_milli":106,...}
```

### Awake detection (heartbeat gating)

Before running heartbeats or reporting sleep-dependent metrics, check if the user is awake:

```bash
whoop awake    # exit 0 = awake (recovery scored), exit 1 = likely sleeping
```

`whoop awake` checks if today's recovery `score_state` is `SCORED`. Whoop calculates recovery after sleep finishes, so an unscored recovery means the user is likely still asleep. Use this to gate heartbeat workflows and avoid reporting invalid metrics.

```bash
# Agent heartbeat pattern
whoop awake && whoop check    # Only report if awake
```

### Agent self-install

```bash
npm install -g @tomasward/whoop-cli
```

### Headless setup (servers / CI)

On machines without a browser, pre-write the config and complete OAuth manually:

```bash
# 1. Write credentials (skip interactive prompt)
mkdir -p ~/.whoop-cli && chmod 700 ~/.whoop-cli
cat > ~/.whoop-cli/config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "client_id": "<your_client_id>",
  "client_secret": "<your_client_secret>",
  "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:8787/callback"
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.whoop-cli/config.json

# 2. Log in — shows a URL, open it on any machine, paste callback URL back
whoop auth login
```

A human must complete `whoop auth login` once (OAuth requires browser authorization). After that, enable keepalive to ensure tokens stay fresh:

```bash
whoop auth keepalive     # Installs cron job (refreshes every 45 min)
```

WHOOP access tokens expire every hour and use [refresh token rotation](https://developer.whoop.com/docs/developing/oauth/) — each refresh invalidates the previous token. Without regular refresh, both tokens expire and require re-login. The keepalive cron prevents this automatically.

### Credential resolution

1. Config file (`~/.whoop-cli/config.json`) — written by interactive setup or manually
2. Environment variables (`WHOOP_CLIENT_ID`, `WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET`) — override config file

## Storage

```
~/.whoop-cli/
├── config.json    # Client credentials (600 perms)
└── tokens.json    # OAuth tokens (600 perms, auto-refresh)
```

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TomasWard1/whoop-cli.git
cd whoop-cli
npm install
npm test           # 65 tests
npm run dev        # Run with tsx
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript
```
